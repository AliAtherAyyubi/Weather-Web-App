# Weather Web App

This is a weather web app built using React.js. The app allows users to search for the weather of any location, displaying the current temperature, forecast, weather icon, and time. Below are some screenshots with explanations of the app's features. 

## Home Page

The home page displays the current weather for a default location. The web app displays the current temperature, weather conditions, an icon, and the current time for the searched location. The forecast section shows the weather forecast for the next few days in a slider, providing a detailed overview of upcoming weather conditions.

## Search Functionality

Users can enter the name of any city in the search bar on the right side to get real-time weather updates. When the user presses the search button, a loading bar appears between the container sections, indicating that the data is being fetched.
